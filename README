This is a iOS app that I coded during the summer of 2014.

It makes some calculations regarding projectile motion.

Some features are that it calculates and displays the highest point
the projectile reaches, how long it takes to reach that point, how far
the projectile travels before hitting the ground, and how long that takes,
based on input from the user in a text field. There are also preset buttons
that make it easy to change the force of gravity to and from earth, mars,
jupiter and more.
